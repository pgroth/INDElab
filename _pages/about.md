The INtelligent Data Engineering Lab is part of the [Informatics Institute](http://ivi.uva.nl) of the [University of Amsterdam](http://uva.nl). It investigates intelligent systems that support people in their work with data and information from diverse sources. This includes addressing problems related to the preparation, management, integration and reuse of data.

We perform both applied and fundamental research informed by empirical insights into data science practice. Recent topics of interest include: data supply chains, data provenance, transparency, information integration, automated knowledge base / knowledge graph construction, and data semantics.

The lab is led by [Paul Groth](http://pgroth.com).
