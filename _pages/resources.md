We are happy to contribute to open source data and software. 

_Data_
* [GitTables](https://gittables.github.io) - a corpus of 1.7 million relational tables extracted from CSV files from GitHub. The table columns have been automatically annotated with types from Schema.org.
* [MeasEval](https://github.com/harperco/MeasEval) - manually annotated dataset for entity and semantic relation extraction focused on finding counts and measurements, attributes of these quantities, and additional contextual information. This was produced for [SemEval-2021 Task 8](https://semeval.github.io/SemEval2021/tasks.html), which we organized. 

_Software_
* [mlinspect](https://github.com/stefan-grafberger/mlinspect) - analyze and inspect python machine learning pipelines to check for common issues.
* [Torch-RGCN](https://github.com/thiviyanT/torch-RGCN) - a pytorch implementation of relational graph convolutional networks.
* [BLP](https://github.com/dfdazac/blp) - a model for performing inductive link prediction and entity classification for knowledge graphs where entites have textual descriptions.
* [BioBLP](https://github.com/elsevier-ai-lab/bioblp) -  a modular framework for learning on multimodal biomedical knowledge graphs
* [conversationkg](https://github.com/INDElab/conversationkg) - package for turning email lists into knowledge graphs.
