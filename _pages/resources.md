We are happy to contribute to open source data and software. 

_Data_
* [BASIL DB](https://basil-db.github.io/about.html) - aggregates data on bioactive compounds derived from natural sources and their associated health effects in the form of a knowledge graph.
* [IntelliGraphs](https://github.com/thiviyanT/IntelliGraphs) - a set of benchmark datasets for knowledge graph generation. Also includes scripts for synthetic generation of knowledge graphs. 
* [GitTables](https://gittables.github.io) - a corpus of 1.7 million relational tables extracted from CSV files from GitHub. The table columns have been automatically annotated with types from Schema.org.
* [MeasEval](https://github.com/harperco/MeasEval) - manually annotated dataset for entity and semantic relation extraction focused on finding counts and measurements, attributes of these quantities, and additional contextual information. This was produced for [SemEval-2021 Task 8](https://semeval.github.io/SemEval2021/tasks.html), which we organized. 


_Software_
* [PyAerial](https://github.com/DiTEC-project/pyaerial) - a Python package for scalable association rule mining from tabular data.
* [wdn-knowledge-graph](https://github.com/DiTEC-project/wdn-knowledge-graph) - a Python package to create a knowledge graph for water distribution networks.
* [mlinspect](https://github.com/stefan-grafberger/mlinspect) - analyze and inspect python machine learning pipelines to check for common issues.
* [Torch-RGCN](https://github.com/thiviyanT/torch-RGCN) - a pytorch implementation of relational graph convolutional networks.
* [BLP](https://github.com/dfdazac/blp) - a model for performing inductive link prediction and entity classification for knowledge graphs where entites have textual descriptions.
* [BioBLP](https://github.com/elsevier-ai-lab/bioblp) -  a modular framework for learning on multimodal biomedical knowledge graphs
* [conversationkg](https://github.com/INDElab/conversationkg) - package for turning email lists into knowledge graphs.
