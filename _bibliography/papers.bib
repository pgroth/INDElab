abstract = {Domain generalization aims to design models that can effectively generalize to unseen target domains by learning from observed source domains. Domain generalization poses a significant challenge for time series data, due to varying data distributions and temporal dependencies. Existing approaches to domain generalization are not designed for time series data, which often results in suboptimal or unstable performance when confronted with diverse temporal patterns and complex data characteristics. We propose a novel approach to tackle the problem of domain generalization in time series forecasting. We focus on a scenario where time series domains share certain common attributes and exhibit no abrupt distribution shifts. Our method revolves around the incorporation of a key regularization term into an existing time series forecasting model: domain discrepancy regularization. In this way, we aim to enforce consistent performance across different domains that exhibit distinct patterns. We calibrate the regularization term by investigating the performance within individual domains and propose the domain discrepancy regularization with domain difficulty awareness. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on multiple datasets, including synthetic and real-world time series datasets from diverse domains such as retail, transportation, and finance. Our method is compared against traditional methods, deep learning models, and domain generalization approaches to provide comprehensive insights into its performance. In these experiments, our method showcases superior performance, surpassing both the base model and competing domain generalization models across all datasets. Furthermore, our method is highly general and can be applied to various time series models.},

abstract="Despite software industries' successful utilization of Service-Oriented Computing (SOC) to streamline software development, machine learning (ML) development has yet to fully integrate these practices. This disparity can be attributed to multiple factors, such as the unique challenges inherent to ML development and the absence of a unified framework for incorporating services into this process. In this paper, we shed light on the disparities between services-oriented computing and machine learning development. We propose ``Everything as a Module'' (XaaM), a framework designed to encapsulate every ML artifacts including models, code, data, and configurations as individual modules, to bridge this gap. We propose a set of additional steps that need to be taken to empower machine learning development using services-oriented computing via an architecture that facilitates efficient management and orchestration of complex ML systems. By leveraging the best practices of services-oriented computing, we believe that machine learning development can achieve a higher level of maturity, improve the efficiency of the development process, and ultimately, facilitate the more effective creation of machine learning applications.",

abstract = {Software systems that learn from data with machine learning (ML) are used in critical decision-making processes. Unfortunately, real-world experience shows that the pipelines for data preparation, feature encoding and model training in ML systems are often brittle with respect to their input data. As a consequence, data scientists have to run different kinds of data centric what-if analyses to evaluate the robustness and reliability of such pipelines, e.g., with respect to data errors or preprocessing techniques. These what-if analyses follow a common pattern: they take an existing ML pipeline, create a pipeline variant by introducing a small change, and execute this variant to see how the change impacts the pipeline's output score.We recently proposed mlwhatif, a library that enables data scientists to declaratively specify what-if analyses for an ML pipeline, and to automatically generate, optimize and execute the required pipeline variants. We demonstrate how data scientists can leverage mlwhatif for a variety of pipelines and three different what-if analyses focusing on the robustness of a pipeline against data errors, the impact of data cleaning operations, and the impact of data preprocessing operations on fairness. In particular, we demonstrate step-by-step how mlwhatif generates and optimizes the required execution plans for the pipeline analyses. Our library is publicly available at https://github.com/stefan-grafberger/mlwhatif.},

abstract = {Modern search and recommendation systems are optimized using logged interaction data. There is increasing societal pressure to enable users of such systems to have some of their data deleted from those systems. This paper focuses on "unlearning" such user data from neighborhood-based recommendation models on sparse, high-dimensional datasets. We present caboose, a custom top-k index for such models, which enables fast and exact deletion of user interactions. We experimentally find that caboose provides competitive index building times, makes sub-second unlearning possible (even for a large index built from one million users and 256 million interactions), and, when integrated into three state-of-the-art next-basket recommendation models, allows users to effectively adjust their predictions to remove sensitive items.},

abstract="The successful application of computational models presupposes access to accurate, relevant, and representative datasets. The growth of public data, and the increasing practice of data sharing and reuse, emphasises the importance of data provenance and increases the need for modellers to understand how data processing decisions might impact model output. One key step in the data processing pipeline is that of data integration and entity resolution, where entities are matched across disparate datasets. In this paper, we present a new formulation of data integration in complex networks that incorporates integration uncertainty. We define an approach for understanding how different data integration setups can impact the results of network diffusion models under this uncertainty, allowing one to systematically characterise potential model outputs in order to create an output distribution that provides a more comprehensive picture.",

  abstract = {"Artificial intelligence systems are not simply built on a single dataset or trained model. Instead, they are made by complex data science workflows involving multiple datasets, models, preparation scripts, and algorithms. Given this complexity, in order to understand these AI systems, we need to provide explanations of their functioning at higher levels of abstraction. To tackle this problem, we focus on the extraction and representation of data journeys from these workflows. A data journey is a multi-layered semantic representation of data processing activity linked to data science code and assets. We propose an ontology to capture the essential elements of a data journey and an approach to extract such data journeys. Using a corpus of Python notebooks from Kaggle, we show that we are able to capture high-level semantic data flow that is more compact than using the code structure itself. Furthermore, we show that introducing an intermediate knowledge graph representation outperforms models that rely only on the code itself. Finally, we report on a user survey to reflect on the challenges and opportunities presented by computational data journeys for explainable AI."}

abstract = {Software systems that learn from data with machine learning (ML) are used in critical decision-making processes. Unfortunately, real-world experience shows that the pipelines for data preparation, feature encoding and model training in ML systems are often brittle with respect to their input data. As a consequence, data scientists have to run different kinds of data centric what-if analyses to evaluate the robustness and reliability of such pipelines, e.g., with respect to data errors or preprocessing techniques. These what-if analyses follow a common pattern: they take an existing ML pipeline, create a pipeline variant by introducing a small change, and execute this pipeline variant to see how the change impacts the pipeline's output score. The application of existing analysis techniques to ML pipelines is technically challenging as they are hard to integrate into existing pipeline code and their execution introduces large overheads due to repeated work.We propose mlwhatif to address these integration and efficiency challenges for data-centric what-if analyses on ML pipelines. mlwhatif enables data scientists to declaratively specify what-if analyses for an ML pipeline, and to automatically generate, optimize and execute the required pipeline variants. Our approach employs pipeline patches to specify changes to the data, operators and models of a pipeline. Based on these patches, we define a multi-query optimizer for efficiently executing the resulting pipeline variants jointly, with four subsumption-based optimization rules. Subsequently, we detail how to implement the pipeline variant generation and optimizer of mlwhatif. For that, we instrument native ML pipelines written in Python to extract dataflow plans with re-executable operators.We experimentally evaluate mlwhatif, and find that its speedup scales linearly with the number of pipeline variants in applicable cases, and is invariant to the input data size. In end-to-end experiments with four analyses on more than 60 pipelines, we show speedups of up to 13x compared to sequential execution, and find that the speedup is invariant to the model and featurization in the pipeline. Furthermore, we confirm the low instrumentation overhead of mlwhatif.},

ML pipelines in these applications often suffer from a variety of data-related issues, such as data leakage, label errors or fairness violations, which require reasoning about complex dependencies between their inputs and outputs. These issues are usually only detected in hindsight after deployment, after they caused harm in production. We demonstrate ArgusEyes, a system which enables data scientists to proactively screen their ML pipelines for data-related issues as part of continuous integration. ArgusEyes instruments, executes and screens ML pipelines for declaratively specified pipeline issues, and analyzes data artifacts and their provenance to catch potential problems early before deployment to production. We demonstrate our system for three scenarios: detecting mislabeled images in a computer vision pipeline, spotting data leakage in a price prediction pipeline, and addressing fairness violations in a credit scoring pipeline.},

Existing table corpora primarily contain tables extracted from HTML pages, limiting the capability to represent offline database tables. To train and evaluate high-capacity models for applications beyond the Web, we need resources with tables that resemble relational database tables. Here we introduce GitTables, a corpus of 1M relational tables extracted from GitHub. Our continuing curation aims at growing the corpus to at least 10M tables. Analyses of GitTables show that its structure, content, and topical coverage differ significantly from existing table corpora. We annotate table columns in GitTables with semantic types, hierarchical relations and descriptions from Schema.org and DBpedia. The evaluation of our annotation pipeline on the T2Dv2 benchmark illustrates that our approach provides results on par with human annotations. We present three applications of GitTables, demonstrating its value for learned semantic type detection models, schema completion methods, and benchmarks for table-to-KG matching, data search, and preparation.

Second, we want the attendees to see the benefit of such line of work in a large variety of data applications. Third, we would like to empower the audience with a new set of tools and to inspire them to tackle some of the important directions for neural table representations, including model and system design, evaluation, application and deployment. To achieve these goals, the tutorial is organized in two parts. The first part covers the background for neural table representations, including a survey of the most important systems. The second part is designed as a hands-on session, where attendees will use their laptop to explore this new framework and test neural models involving text and tabular data.},

We accomplish this by supporting the flexible integration of multiple obfuscation techniques and studying deployment strategies for privacy-enforcing mechanisms. In addition, we share ideas on how to model the adversary's knowledge to select appropriate obfuscation techniques for the discussed deployment strategies. Initial results indicate that flexibly choosing obfuscation techniques and deployment strategies is essential to conceal privacy-sensitive event patterns accurately.},

abstract = "Sensory data profoundly influences the quality of detected events in a distributed complex event processing system (DCEP). Since each sensor{\textquoteright}s status is unstable at runtime, a single sensing assignment is often insufficient to fulfill the consumer{\textquoteright}s quality requirements. In this paper, we study in the context of AQuA-CEP the problem of dynamic quality monitoring and adaptation of complex event processing by active integration of suitable data sources. To support this, in AQuA-CEP, queries to detect complex events are supplemented with consumer-definable quality policies that are evaluated and used to autonomously select (or even configure) suitable data sources of the sensing infrastructure. In addition, we studied different forms of expressing quality policies and analyzed how it affects the quality monitoring process. Various modes of evaluating and applying quality-related adaptations and their impacts on correlation efficiency are addressed, too. We assessed the performance of AQuA-CEP in IoT scenarios by utilizing the notion of the quality policy alongside the query processing adaptation using knowledge derived from quality monitoring. The results show that AQuA-CEP can improve the performance of DCEP systems in terms of the quality of results while fulfilling the consumer{\textquoteright}s quality requirements. Quality-based adaptation can also increase the network{\textquoteright}s lifetime by optimizing the sensor{\textquoteright}s energy consumption due to efficient data source selection.",

abstract = {In two-sided marketplaces, items compete for attention from users since attention translates to revenue for suppliers. Item exposure is an indication of the amount of attention that items receive from users in a ranking. It can be influenced by factors like position bias. Recent work suggests that another phenomenon related to inter-item dependencies may also affect item exposure, viz. outlier items in the ranking. Hence, a deeper understanding of outlier items is crucial to determining an item’s exposure distribution. In this work, we study the impact of different presentational e-commerce features on users’ perception of outlierness of an item in a search result page. Informed by visual search literature, we design a set of crowdsourcing tasks where we compare the observability of three main features, viz. price, star rating, and discount tag. We find that various factors affect item outlierness, namely, visual complexity (e.g., shape, color), discriminative item features, and value range. In particular, we observe that a distinctive visual feature such as a colored discount tag can attract users’ attention much easier than a high price difference, simply because of visual characteristics that are easier to spot. Moreover, we see that the magnitude of deviations in all features affects the task complexity, such that when the similarity between outlier and non-outlier items increases, the task becomes more difficult.},

abstract = {This article introduces the task of visual named entity discovery in videos without the need for task-specific supervision or task-specific external knowledge sources. Assigning specific names to entities (e.g., faces, scenes, or objects) in video frames is a long-standing challenge. Commonly, this problem is addressed as a supervised learning objective by manually annotating entities with labels. To bypass the annotation burden of this setup, several works have investigated the problem by utilizing external knowledge sources such as movie databases. While effective, such approaches do not work when task-specific knowledge sources are not provided and can only be applied to movies and TV series. In this work, we take the problem a step further and propose to discover entities in videos from videos and corresponding captions or subtitles. We introduce a three-stage method where we (i) create bipartite entity-name graphs from frame–caption pairs, (ii) find visual entity agreements, and (iii) refine the entity assignment through entity-level prototype construction. To tackle this new problem, we outline two new benchmarks, SC-Friends and SC-BBT, based on the Friends and Big Bang Theory TV series. Experiments on the benchmarks demonstrate the ability of our approach to discover which named entity belongs to which face or scene, with an accuracy close to a supervised oracle, just from the multimodal information present in videos. Additionally, our qualitative examples show the potential challenges of self-contained discovery of any visual entity for future work. The code and the data are available on GitHub.1},

            Numerous studies have explored the use of language models and question answering techniques for knowledge extraction. In most cases, these models are trained on data specific to the new task at hand. We hypothesize that using models trained only on generic question answering data (e.g. SQuAD) is a good starting point for domain specific entity extraction. We test this hypothesis, and explore whether the addition of small amounts of training data can help lift model performance. We pay special attention to the use of null answers and unanswerable questions to optimize performance. To our knowledge, no studies have been done to evaluate the effectiveness of this technique. We do so for an end-to-end entity mention detection and entity typing task on HAnDS and FIGER, two common evaluation datasets for fine grained entity recognition. We focus on fine-grained entity recognition because it is challenging scenario, and because the long tail of types in this task highlights the need for entity extraction systems that can deal with new domains and types. To our knowledge, we are the first system beyond those presented in the original FIGER and HAnDS papers to tackle the task in an end-to-end fashion. Using an extremely small sample from the distantly-supervised HAnDS training data – 0.0015\%, or less than 500 passages randomly chosen out of 31 million – we produce a CoNNL F1 score of 73.72 for entity detection on FIGER. Our end-to-end detection and typing evaluation produces macro and micro F1s of 45.11 and 54.75, based on the FIGER evaluation metrics. This work provides a foundation for the rapid development of new knowledge extraction pipelines.},

abstract = {Session-based recommendation predicts the next item with which a user will interact, given a sequence of her past interactions with other items. This machine learning problem targets a core scenario in e-commerce platforms, which aim to recommend interesting items to buy to users browsing the site. Session-based recommenders are difficult to scale due to their exponentially large input space of potential sessions. This impedes offline precomputation of the recommendations, and implies the necessity to maintain state during the online computation of next-item recommendations.We propose VMIS-kNN, an adaptation of a state-of-the-art nearest neighbor approach to session-based recommendation, which leverages a prebuilt index to compute next-item recommendations with low latency in scenarios with hundreds of millions of clicks to search through. Based on this approach, we design and implement the scalable session-based recommender system Serenade, which is in production usage at bol.com, a large European e-commerce platform.We evaluate the predictive performance of VMIS-kNN, and show that Serenade can answer a thousand recommendation requests per second with a 90th percentile latency of less than seven milliseconds in scenarios with millions of items to recommend. Furthermore, we present results from a three week long online A/B test with up to 600 requests per second for 6.5 million distinct items on more than 45 million user sessions from our e-commerce platform. To the best of our knowledge, we provide the first empirical evidence that the superior predictive performance of nearest neighbor approaches to session-based recommendation in offline evaluations translates to superior performance in a real world e-commerce setting.},

It consists of a generator trained to extract spans from an input sentence, and a discriminator trained to determine whether a span comes from the generator, or from the gazetteer.We evaluate the method on English newswire data and compare it against supervised, weakly-supervised, and unsupervised methods. We find that the performance of the method is lower than these baselines, because it tends to generate more and longer spans, and in some cases it relies only on capitalization. In other cases, it generates spans that are valid but differ from the benchmark. When evaluated with metrics based on overlap, we find that SlotGAN performs within 95{\%} of the precision of a supervised method, and 84{\%} of its recall. Our results suggest that the model can generate spans that overlap well, but an additional filtering mechanism is required.",

However,  scientific articles may be ambiguous,  incomplete and difficult to process by automated systems. In this paper we introduce RO-Crate,  an open,  community-driven,  and lightweight approach to packaging research artefacts along with their metadata in a machine readable manner. RO-Crate is based on Schema.org annotations in JSON-LD,  aiming to establish best practices to formally describe metadata in an accessible and practical way for their use in a wide variety of situations. An RO-Crate is a structured archive of all the items that contributed to a research outcome,  including their identifiers,  provenance,  relations and annotations. As a general purpose packaging approach for data and their metadata,  RO-Crate is used across multiple areas,  including bioinformatics,  digital humanities and regulatory sciences. By applying “just enough” Linked Data standards,  RO-Crate simplifies the process of making research outputs FAIR while also enhancing research reproducibility.

abstract = {Long-form conversations such as email are an important source of information for knowledge capture. For tasks such as knowledge graph construction, conversational search, and entity linking, being able to resolve entities from across documents is important. Building on recent work on within document coreference resolution for email, we study for the first time a cross-document formulation of the problem. Our results show that the current state-of-the-art deep learning models for general cross-document coreference resolution are insufficient for email conversations. Our experiments show that the general task is challenging and, importantly for knowledge intensive tasks, coreference resolution models that only treat entity mentions perform worse. Based on these results, we outline the work needed to address this challenging task.},

abstract = {Deploying deep reinforcement learning in safety-critical settings requires developing algorithms that obey hard constraints during exploration. This paper contributes a first approach toward enforcing formal safety constraints on end-to-end policies with visual inputs. Our approach draws on recent advances in object detection and automated reasoning for hybrid dynamical systems. The approach is evaluated on a novel benchmark that emphasizes the challenge of safely exploring in the presence of hard constraints. Our benchmark draws from several proposed problem sets for safe learning and includes problems that emphasize challenges such as reward signals that are not aligned with safety constraints. On each of these benchmark problems, our algorithm completely avoids unsafe behavior while remaining competitive at optimizing for as much reward as is safe. We characterize safety constraints in terms of a refinement relation on Markov decision processes - rather than directly constraining the reinforcement learning algorithm so that it only takes safe actions, we instead refine the environment so that only safe actions are defined in the environment's transition structure. This has pragmatic system design benefits and, more importantly, provides a clean conceptual setting in which we are able to prove important safety and efficiency properties. These allow us to transform the constrained optimization problem of acting safely in the original environment into an unconstrained optimization in a refined environment.},

abstract = {Software systems that learn from user data with machine learning (ML) have become ubiquitous over the last years. Recent law such as the "General Data Protection Regulation" (GDPR) requires organisations that process personal data to delete user data upon request (enacting the "right to be forgotten"). However, this regulation does not only require the deletion of user data from databases, but also applies to ML models that have been learned from the stored data. We therefore argue that ML applications should offer users to unlearn their data from trained models in a timely manner. We explore how fast this unlearning can be done under the constraints imposed by real world deployments, and introduce the problem of low-latency machine unlearning: maintaining a deployed ML model in-place under the removal of a small fraction of training samples without retraining.We propose HedgeCut, a classification model based on an ensemble of randomised decision trees, which is designed to answer unlearning requests with low latency. We detail how to efficiently implement HedgeCut with vectorised operators for decision tree learning. We conduct an experimental evaluation on five privacy-sensitive datasets, where we find that HedgeCut can unlearn training samples with a latency of around 100 microseconds and answers up to 36,000 prediction requests per second, while providing a training time and predictive accuracy similar to widely used implementations of tree-based ML models such as Random Forests.},

abstract = {Machine Learning (ML) is increasingly used to automate impactful decisions, and the risks arising from this wide-spread use are garnering attention from policymakers, scientists, and the media. ML applications are often very brittle with respect to their input data, which leads to concerns about their reliability, accountability, and fairness. While bias detection cannot be fully automated, computational tools can help pinpoint particular types of data issues.We recently proposed mlinspect, a library that enables lightweight lineage-based inspection of ML preprocessing pipelines. In this demonstration, we show how mlinspect can be used to detect data distribution bugs in a representative pipeline. In contrast to existing work, mlinspect operates on declarative abstractions of popular data science libraries like estimator/transformer pipelines, can handle both relational and matrix data, and does not require manual code instrumentation. The library is publicly available at https://github.com/stefan-grafberger/mlinspect.},

abstract = {Entity alignment (EA) is the task of identifying the entities that refer to the same real-world object but are located in different knowledge graphs (KGs). For entities to be aligned, existing EA solutions treat them separately and generate alignment results as ranked lists of entities on the other side. Nevertheless, this decision-making paradigm fails to take into account the interdependence among entities. Although some recent efforts mitigate this issue by imposing the 1-to-1 constraint on the alignment process, they still cannot adequately model the underlying interdependence and the results tend to be sub-optimal.To fill in this gap, in this work, we delve into the dynamics of the decision-making process, and offer a reinforcement learning (RL)–based model to align entities collectively. Under the RL framework, we devise the coherence and exclusiveness constraints to characterize the interdependence and restrict collective alignment. Additionally, to generate more precise inputs to the RL framework, we employ representative features to capture different aspects of the similarity between entities in heterogeneous KGs, which are integrated by an adaptive feature fusion strategy. Our proposal is evaluated on both cross-lingual and mono-lingual EA benchmarks and compared against state-of-the-art solutions. The empirical results verify its effectiveness and superiority.},

Descriptions of smells in text, or as we call them {`}smell experiences{'}, offer a window into these factors, but they must first be identified. To the best of our knowledge, no tool exists to extract references to smell experiences from text. In this paper, we present two variations on a semi-supervised approach to identify smell experiences in English literature. The combined set of patterns from both implementations offer significantly better performance than a keyword-based baseline.",

Here, we study how different distributed representations of academic papers (i.e. embeddings) impact academic expert retrieval. We use the Microsoft Academic Graph dataset and experiment with different configurations of a document-centric voting model for retrieval. In particular, we explore the impact of the use of contextualized embeddings on search performance. We also present results for paper embeddings that incorporate citation information through retrofitting. Additionally, experiments are conducted using different techniques for assigning author weights based on author order. We observe that using contextual embeddings produced by a transformer model trained for sentence similarity tasks produces the most effective paper representations for document-centric expert retrieval. However, retrofitting the paper embeddings and using elaborate author contribution weighting strategies did not improve retrieval performance.",

Despite this potential, relatively little attention has been paid to a key step in data reuse: the behaviours involved in data-centric sensemaking. We aim to address this gap by presenting a mixed-methods study combining in-depth interviews, a think-aloud task and a screen recording analysis with 31 researchers from different disciplines as they summarised and interacted with both familiar and unfamiliar data. We use our findings to identify and detail common patterns of data-centric sensemaking across three clusters of activities that we present as a framework: inspecting data, engaging with content, and placing data within broader contexts. Additionally, we propose design recommendations for tools and documentation practices, which can be used to facilitate sensemaking and subsequent data reuse."

For example, they allow us to find documents relevant to a specific entity irrespective of the underlying syntactic expression within a document. However, the entities that are commonly represented in knowledge bases are often a simplification of what is truly being referred to in text. For example, in a knowledge base, we may have an entity for Germany as a country but not for the more fuzzy concept of Germany that covers notions of German Population, German Drivers, and the German Government. Inspired by recent advances in contextual word embeddings, we introduce the concept of entity spaces - specific representations of a set of associated entities with near-identity. Thus, these entity spaces provide a handle to an amorphous grouping of entities. We developed a proof-of-concept for English showing how, through the introduction of entity spaces in the form of disambiguation pages, the recall of entity linking can be improved.},

            Robotic labs, in which experiments are carried out entirely by robots, have the potential to provide a reproducible and transparent foundation for performing basic biomedical laboratory experiments. In this article, we investigate whether these labs could be applicable in current experimental practice. We do this by text mining 1,628 papers for occurrences of methods that are supported by commercial robotic labs. Using two different concept recognition tools, we find that 86%–89% of the papers have at least one of these methods. This and our other results provide indications that robotic labs can serve as the foundation for performing many lab-based experiments.

title = "The FAIR Guiding Principles for scientific data management and stewardship",
abstract = "There is an urgent need to improve the infrastructure supporting the reuse of scholarly data. A diverse set of stakeholders-representing academia, industry, funding agencies, and scholarly publishers-have come together to design and jointly endorse a concise and measureable set of principles that we refer to as the FAIR Data Principles. The intent is that these may act as a guideline for those wishing to enhance the reusability of their data holdings. Distinct from peer initiatives that focus on the human scholar, the FAIR Principles put specific emphasis on enhancing the ability of machines to automatically find and use the data, in addition to supporting its reuse by individuals. This Comment is the first formal publication of the FAIR Principles, and includes the rationale behind them, and some exemplar implementations in the community.",
