We're happy to be at [ESWC](https://2025.eswc-conferences.org) this week. Melika is presenting [her work](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1i6zLWc1OD9fDxo3F-Nyv_mIf7q5-Nx2w/view) on how to design ontologies for hyperbolic embeddings in the research track. Paul is giving keynotes at the [SemTech4STLD](https://semtech4stld.github.io) and the [XAI-KG](https://xaikg2025.demacs.unical.it) workshops. We are also representing the [ENEXA project](http://enexa.eu) at the networking session.
