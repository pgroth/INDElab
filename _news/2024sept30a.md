We're happy to be at [ECCV](https://eccv.ecva.net/Conferences/2024) this week. Melika is presenting her work on continual hyperbolic learning at the [Instance-Level Recognition Workshop](https://ilr-workshop.github.io/ECCVW2024/) as well as her work on [self-supervised pretraining](https://melika.xyz/data/paper.pdf) for precise spatial understanding at the [self-supervised learning workshop](https://sslwin.org/#schedule). Teresa is also attending. Say hi!
