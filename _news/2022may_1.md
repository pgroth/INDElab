We are happy to be participating at [ICDE'22](https://icde2022.ieeecomputer.my). Paul is giving a keynote at the [Databases and ML workshop](https://www.wis.ewi.tudelft.nl/dbml2022). Also at the workshop is a paper on [GitSchemas](https://github.com/tdoehmen/gitschemas) led by Till DÃ¶hmen and co-authored with Madelon and Sebastian. Sebastian is also on a [panel](https://icde2022.ieeecomputer.my/phd-symposium-program/) for the PhD Symposium.
