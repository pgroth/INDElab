We're happy to be at both [ECAI](https://www.ecai2024.eu) and [CIKM](https://cikm2024.org) this week where our work on entity linking under temporal change led by Pengyu is being presented. The papers are: [TIGER: Temporally Improved Graph Entity Linker](https://ebooks.iospress.nl/volumearticle/70028) and [CYCLE: Cross-Year Contrastive Learning in Entity-Linking](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3627673.3679702).
