Congrats to Daniel and Thiviyan who had papers accepted at NeurIPS 2023. Thiviyan's paper with colleagues from the VU L&R group was on [scalable probalistic neurosympbolic inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.12393). Daniel worked with the VU, Edinburgh and Copenhangen to study [data efficient complex query answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.12313).
