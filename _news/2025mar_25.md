We're happy to be at [EDBT](https://edbticdt2025.upc.edu) this week. Hazar has a [paper](https://openproceedings.org/2025/conf/edbt/paper-152.pdf) on improving ML accuracy with data cleaning. Zeyu is presenting at the [next gen data management systems event](https://edbticdt2025.upc.edu/?contents=next_generation_dms.html), attending the PhD Symposium and is presenting his paper on [cross-dataset entity matching with LLMs](https://openproceedings.org/2025/conf/edbt/paper-224.pdf). Say hi!
