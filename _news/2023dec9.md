We're happy to be at NeurIPS 2023 this week. We have papers in the main conference on [complex query answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.12313) and [neurosymbolic inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.12393) as well as papers in the [Table Representation Learning](https://table-representation-learning.github.io), [Causal Representation Learning](https://crl-workshop.github.io) and [Graph Frontiers Workshops](https://glfrontiers.github.io). Say hi to Daniel, Danru and Madelon (alum) if you're there.
