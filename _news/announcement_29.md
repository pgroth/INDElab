On October 10th, in conjunction with, Paul's [inaugural lecture](https://amsterdamdatascience.nl/event/inaugural-lecture-paul-groth/), we will be hosting an exciting seminar, [The work behind data](https://www.spui25.nl/spui25-en/events/events/2019/10/the-work-behind-data.html). Both events are open. Do come. These are co-hosted with Amsterdam Data Science.
