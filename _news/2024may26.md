We're happy to be at ESWC this week. We have a [paper](https://2024.eswc-conferences.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/77770011.pdf) in the special track on LLMs and knowledge engineering. Paul is giving a keynote talk at the [Text2KG workshop](https://aiisc.ai/text2kg2024/), is on panel at the [DQMLKG workshop](https://dqmlkg.github.io). Our project ENEXA will also be in the poster session and Discovery Lab is well represented throughout the event.
