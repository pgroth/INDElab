We're excited to be attending the [EGOS Colloquium](https://www.egos.org/) this week in Athens. Teresa will give a presentation on her work titled "Creative endurance in the fashion industry: do styles go a long way? A computational approach to organizational and individual style recognizability". Say hi!
