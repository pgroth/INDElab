We're across the street at [EKAW](https://event.cwi.nl/ekaw2024/) this week. We have two main track papers on [object influence retrieval](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-77792-9_3) authored by Teresa & Paul together with the Amsterdam Business School and the [impact of entity linking on network construction](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-77792-9_5) authored by James and Paul together with GESIS. Lise is the EKAW workshop & tutorial program co-chair. Victoria is organizing the [KNUMS workshop](https://k-nums.github.io/ekaw/2024/#chairs) on knowledgement management for numerical modeling.  Jan-Christoph is giving a keynote at the [X-Tail workshop](https://www.xtail-workshop.org/). Additionally, we have two papers at the [ELMKE workshop](https://sites.google.com/view/elmke/program) on RAG for ontologies led by Antonis with Lise and [LLMs for learning ontologies](https://github.com/DiTEC-project/Large-Language-Model-for-Ontology-Learning-In-Drinking-Water-Distribution-Network-Domain) for drinking water co-authored by Victoria and Erkan.
