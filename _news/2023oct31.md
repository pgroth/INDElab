We're happy to be at ISWC next week! Check out Erkan, Viktoriya and Paul's [paper on rule learning from time series and KGs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.07348.pdf) at the [SemIIM 2023 workshop](https://sites.google.com/view/semiim-2023/home). Also, Jan-Christoph is organizing the [KBC-LM workshop](https://lm-kbc.github.io/workshop2023/#page-top), where Effy, Fina and Paul have a [paper on relation extraction with finetuned LMs](https://lm-kbc.github.io/workshop2023/proceedings/15_Li.pdf) and [a challenge paper](https://lm-kbc.github.io/workshop2023/proceedings/3_Li.pdf) with collaborators.
