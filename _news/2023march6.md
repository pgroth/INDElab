We're happy to be at BTW and WU Vienna this week. Paul is giving a talk at WU Vienna about [Data Curation and Debugging for Data-Centric AI](https://www.wu.ac.at/en/dpkm/news-details/detail/guest-talk-paul-groth-data-curation-and-debugging-for-data-centric-ai/). Sebastian and Madelon will attend the [ML for Systems and Systems for ML workshop at BTW](https://sites.google.com/view/btw-2023-tud/program/workshops/w1-ml-for-systems-and-systems-for-ml) to talk about Provenance-based Screening of ML pipelines and Table Representation Learning, respectively.
