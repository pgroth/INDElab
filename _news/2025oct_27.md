We are happy to be at [ECAI 2025](https://ecai2025.org/) this week. Erkan presented his work on [Discovering Association Rules in High-Dimensional Small Tabular Data](https://erkankarabulut.github.io/posters/Discovering%20Association%20Rules%20in%20High-Dimensional%20Small%20Tabular%20Data.pdf) at the [ANSyA workshop](https://ansya-workshop.github.io/2025/). Additionally, we have a paper in the main conference co-authored by Jan-Christoph. Say hi!
