Weâ€™re happy to be part of the COST [Global Network on Large-Scale, Cross-domain and Multilingual Open Knowledge Graphs (GOBLIN)](https://www.cost.eu/actions/CA23147/) project. At the kick-off meeting last week in Prague, Teresa presented a poster, Jan gave a keynote, and Lise led sessions organising work done in working group 1 on knowledge representation.
